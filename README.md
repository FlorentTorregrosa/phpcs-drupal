# Florent Torregrosa PHPCS Drupal

[![Automated tests](https://github.com/FlorentTorregrosa/phpcs-drupal/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FlorentTorregrosa/phpcs-drupal/actions)

This library defines rules for [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

It is intended to be used in addition of Drupal [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder)
and it does not replace it, only provides additional rules.


## Installation

Same installation instructions as Drupal [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder).

Replace the Composer package `drupal/coder` by `florenttorregrosa/phpcs_drupal`
in the instructions.


## Configuration

Same configuration instructions as Drupal [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder).

The additional ruleset is named `FlorentTorregrosaDrupalPractice`.
